# Climber-Simulator [WIP]

3D mountain climbing simulator made in Unity.

## About

This is an adventure game about climbing mountains in harsh environment and challenging weather conditions.

Terrain is procedurally generated using Ridged Perlin Noise, while paths and camps locations are generated using modified Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm.

## Future Plans

In the future, I want to add multiplayer support, so players can explore and climb mountains together.

I'm also planning to add more survival like mechanics such as hunger, thirst, body temperature and oxygen levels to increase the difficulty and make game more realistic.
